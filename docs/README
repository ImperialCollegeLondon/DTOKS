## Introduction
At Imperial College, London the code Dust in TOKamaks (DTOKS) was developed in 
2005 by James D. Martin, Michael Coppins and John Allen. Since, it has been 
further developed by Minas Bacharis and others. DTOKS represents a relatively 
independant and unique approach to computing dust tracks in tokamaks and has had
some implementation modelling dust in MAST, ITER, JET and radiofrequency 
discharges.

James Martin, and various papers:

## How to Install/Setup DTOKSU

DTOKS-U depends on several other packages for principally for providing the 
configuration file handling (config4cpp) and for extracting data from NETCDF 
files. For this reason, several other dependancies must first be installed. 
The setup.sh and install_netcdf4.sh scripts will attempt to perform this 
automatically though are liable to fail! 

By Default, DTOKS-U is built with netcdf capability enabled. To disable this,
you must avoid running the install_netcdf4.sh script, by commenting this line
out of the setup.sh script.

To Install DTOKSU, follow steps 1 to 5 given below:
1) First, we need to download the files. To Git clone the repository

	git clone https://github.com/LukeSimons/DTOKS-U.git


2) Run the setup script, this will in turn install the dependancies using the 
install_netcdf4.sh script. IF YOU DON'T WANT THESE DEPENDENCIES, COMMENT THIS
LINE OUT OF THE SETUP SCRIPT BEFORE RUNNING.

	. setup.sh


3) If there are no significant errors or conflicts after this, setup the CMAKE
build directory. By default, the NETCDF support is enabled and the test
directory is not build. So there are a few options available

a) Configure DTOKS core files with config4cpp dependency

	cd build
	cmake ../. -DBUILD_NETCDF=OFF

b) Configure DTOKS core files with config4cpp and build test directory

	cd build
	cmake ../. -DBUILD_TESTS=ON

c) Configure DTOKS core files with config4cpp and NETCDF dependency

	cd build
	cmake ../.


4) DTOKSU can now be built with CMAKE.
	make

5a) The code can then be run in default mode:

	cd ..
	./bin/dtoksu -h
	./bin/dtoksu


5b) Alternatively, if the test directory has been built following step 3b), the
tests can be ran

	cd ..
	./bin/init_test -h
	./bin/init_test -m Gravity
	./bin/unit_test -h
	./bin/unit_test -m DeltaSec


===============================================================================

## How to Run DTOKSU
The built executable and library files are kept in the /bin/ directory. There 
are four executables named:
	dtoksu  int_test model_test  unit_test

For details on how to use the three test executables, see the file:
Tests/README_TESTING

The 'dtoksu' executable is used to run the code, with the following command
line options available:
	
./bin/dtoks -h <help message> -c <Config File> -t <Inital Temperature> 
	-m <'w', 'g', 'b', 'd' or 'f'> 	-s <Initial Radius> 
	-vr <Radial Velocity> -vt <Angular Velocity> -vz <longitudinal velocity>
	-rr <Radial position> -rt <Angular position> -rz <longitudinal position>
	-op <Output File Pre-fix> -om <MetaData filename>


## DTOKSU Class Structure and Design
DTOKSU follows an object oriented programing (oop) style with a few different 
class heirarchies and data structures being used to manage the information. 
These have been designed with simplicity and security in mind and with maximal 
modular capability.

The two principal abstract base classes are the Matter.h class and the Model.h 
class. These classes and their children are operated by the wrapper class DTOKSU 
to conduct the entire simulation. The class DTOKSU_Manager is used to setup 
and correctly configure instances of DTOKSU.

# Matter class
The Matter class is used to contain all the information about the dust grain 
but also to simulate all the physical models directly related to the information
contained. It owns an instance of both the 'GrainData' and 'ElementConsts' which
are found in the GrainStructs.h file. This stores the non-constant and constant 
information about the material. In addition to this, Matter.h stores information
on what models are being allowed to vary with temperature. The matter class 
requires that classes which inherit from it define the functions 
"update_radius()", "update_heatcapacity()" and "update_vapourpressure()" which 
define the variation of radius, heat capacity and vapour pressure with 
temperature.

It contains functions able to alter the description of a dust grain including 
it's motion, these are namely "update_temperature", "update_motion", 
"update_charge" and "update_mass". Finally, a range of getter and one setter 
methods exist for classes external to the heirarchy, mainly DTOKSU to access 
this information. This class requires the definition of the "threevector.h" 
class, the "Constants.h", additionaly "Functions.h" and obviously the data 
structures in "GrainStructs.h"

The class can be constructed simply by passing a pointer to the element 
constants data structure which contains all the unmutable information about a 
materials properties. The default values for it's variable properaties are set 
by default.

Inforamtion about the plasma and dust particle are held within the PlasmaData.h
and GrainStructs.h structures. Constants.h contains physical constants and 
preprocessor directives for debugging Functions.h contains a warning function,
 a rounding function and as well as methods used to calculate physical models.
The DTOKSU_Manager.h class is used to read in and hold the information about a
plasma background with spatial dependance over a cartesian grid. The 
PlasmaGenerator.cpp file is used to generate grids of data for different plasma 
backgrounds which can be fed to the PlasmaGrid class.

# Model.h class
The Model.h class is used as the base for solving the four principal equations
governing the behaviour of the dust. These are the force balance, current 
balance and the equation for the heat flux. Instances of the Model class hold a 
pointer to the Matter class which is established to be the pointer to the same
Matter object as initialised by DTOKSU_Manager. They also share a pointer to 
the same PlasmaData object. The Model class has information about the Plasma 
Grid and has member data specifying the accuracy of the models, the time step,
and total time elapsed as measured by that model. 

The Model class owns two file streams, one of which is used to record the 
plasma data at each time step and one of which records the model data.

# PlasmaData/PlasmaBackground
First, the dust particle is located within the Plasma grid and assigned integer 
coordinates giving it's position. The plasma velocity is defined by the 
direction of the magnetic field and the mean plasma velocity provided the 
densities sum is non-zero. The value of the potential on the grid points are 
taken from input files for each machine type (MAST, ITER, Magnum-PSI, EAST or
DIII-D). The electric field in the radial direction is calculated from the 
difference in potential between two points and similarly calculated for the 
other three dimensions in cylindrical coordinates.
