// # ModelTesting:
// This directory contains Tests of individual component models of DTOKSU, meaning the
// Heating Model, Charging Model and Force Model. The purpose of these tests is to compare
// the difference in result between the original models present in DTOKS with the four
// additional models since I began work on the code. These namely are:
// 
// Neutral drag, Neutral Heating, Evaporative Cooling (and Mass loss), Variable Heat capacity,
// Variable Emissivity
// 
// Additionally, there is a test to compare the difference between the original DTOKS heating
// model with and without these newer models. The following standard plasma conditions are
// utilised throughout these tests unless otherwise stated:
// 
// DustSize         = 1e-6;         // m
// Temp             = 280;          // K
// Potential        = 1;            // Normalised Potential
// NeutralDensity   = 1e18;         // m^-3, Neutral Density
// IonDensity       = 1e18;         // m^-3, Ion Density
// ElectronDensity  = 1e18;         // m^-3, Electron Density
// NeutralTemp      = 10*1.16e4;    // K, Neutral Temperature, convert from eV
// IonTemp          = 10*1.16e4;    // K, Ion Temperature, convert from eV
// ElectronTemp     = 10*1.16e4;    // K, Electron Temperature, convert from eV
// 
// For each pair of tests, two different text files are generated with the force data within
// them. Both are named after the name of the function. In the case of the 'neutraldragtest'
// function, they are "Data/NeutralDragOn.txt" and "Data/NeutralDragOff.txt".

// NOTE! These tests must be run from the /DTOKS-U/ directory since the file paths to the plasma
// data and emissivity data files are relative not global.

//		Model Test 1, Neutral Drag Test:
//		This test evaluates the effect of introducing the neutral drag force into DTOKS. The force
//		model is used with an arbitrary initial position (1.0,0.0,0.0). The initial velocity of
//		the dust is set to (2.0,3.0,5.0) with the plasma velocity being set to
//		PlasmaVelocity   = (0.0,0.0,0.5*sqrt(Kb*NeutralTemp/Mp));
//		The equation for neutral drag is given by:
//		Fnd = (PlasmaVelocity-SampleVelocity)*Mp*sqrt(4*PI)*NeutralFlux*PI*pow(SampleRadius,2)/SampleMass
//		The numerical solution over 100,000 time steps is calculated. The results for with and
//		without the neutral drag force can readily be compared.
//		out = NeutralDragTest(Element[i],false);
//		out = NeutralDragTest(Element[i],true);

//		Model Test 2, Neutral Heating Test:
//		This test evaluates the effect of including Neutral heating in the heating model. The
//		neutral heating term is given by:
//		NeutralHeatFlux = SurfaceArea*2*NeutralFlux*NeutralTemperature*Kb; // Watts		
//		The heating model is until the sample vapourises or reaches thermal equilibrium.
//		out = NeutralHeatingTest(Element[i],false);
//		out = NeutralHeatingTest(Element[i],true);

//		Model Test 3, Evaporative Cooling Test:
//		This test evaluates the effect of energy and mass loss within the heating model. The mass
//		loss provides an additional end condition for the simulation below the boiling temperature
//		due to vaporisation. The equation for evaporative cooling is given by the Hertz-Knudsen
//		equation which is
//		EvaporativeFlux = (StickCoeff*SampleSurfaceArea*AvNo*(SampleVapourPressure-AmbientPressure))/
//		                        sqrt(2*PI*SampleAtomicMass*R*DustTemperature);
//		which gives the rate of mass loss as
//		MassLoss = EvaporationFlux*SampleAtomicMass/AvNo
//		and the rate of energy loss
//		HeatLoss = EvaporationFlux*(3*Kb*DustTemperature/2)+SampleBondEnergy/AvNo)
//		The heating model is ran until the sample vapourises or reaches thermal equilibrium.
//		out = EvaporativeCoolingTest(Element[i],false);
//		out = EvaporativeCoolingTest(Element[i],true);

//		Model Test 4, Variable Heat Capacity:
//		This test evaluates the effect of allowing Heat capacity to vary as a function of
//		temperature. For each of the different materials, a different empirical relation has been
//		used to define the variation with temperature. Most of these relations are found at:
//		Chase, M. (1998). NIST-JANAF Thermochemical Tables, 4th Edition.
//		Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data, Monograph 9.
//		These are compared to the 'default' constant values of heat capacity which are set by the
//		constructors of each element where, by design, a function called '<elementname>_defaults()'
//		is called by the constructor to establish their value.
//		out = VariableHeatCapacityTest(Element[i],false);
//		out = VariableHeatCapacityTest(Element[i],true);

//		Model Test 5, Variable Emissivity Test:
//		This test evaluates the effect of allowing Emissivity to vary as a function of
//		temperature and size. For each of the different materials, a set of tabulated data has
//		been generated from the Wiscombe Mie scattering Fortran code, see reference
//		Wiscombe, W. J. (1980). Improved Mie scattering algorithms. Applied Optics, 19(9), 1505â€“9.
//		This data is not available in the github repository but can be made available locally
//		if placed under the heading:
//		/Models/EmissivityData/EmissivityData<ElementName>/Temp_<Temperature(K)>.txt
//		for example ...
//		/Models/EmissivityData/EmissivityDataIron/Temp_1383.txt
//		where Temp_1383.txt contains two collum data for a temperature of 1383K of comma delimited
//		data. The first collum is the size of the dust grain in metres and the second collum is
//		the emissivity.
//		These are compared to the 'default' constant values of emissivity which are set by the
//		constructors of each element where, by design, a function called '<elementname>_defaults()'
//		is called by the constructor to establish their value.
//		out = VariableEmissivityTest(Element[i],false);
//		out = VariableEmissivityTest(Element[i],true);

//		Model Test 6, Before After Heating Test:
//		This test evaluates the total effect of the introduction of all four of the new models
//		to the heating model. This includes the variational emissivity and heat capacity, plus the
//		addition of the neutral heating and evaporative cooling terms. 
//		These are compared to the 'default value' versions with the additional two terms in the heat
//		equation turned off.
		out = BeforeAfterHeatingTest(Element[i],false);
		out = BeforeAfterHeatingTest(Element[i],true);
