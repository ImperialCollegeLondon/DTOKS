	// Delta Sec Unit Test:
	// This test prints the value of the empirical function calculating the yield due to secondary electron emission.
	// The result can be readily compared to the publication

	// ***** CHARGING TESTS ***** //

	// Charging Timescale Test:
	// This test is used to verify that the timestep as calculated by Krasheninnikovs is always smaller
	// than the electron plasma frequency. In practice, this is found to not be perfectly true, there exist
	// extreme conditions where this is not the case.
	// Time step based on the formulation by Krasheninnikov
	// Smirnov, R. D., Pigarov, A. Y., Rosenberg, M., Krasheninnikov, S. I., & Mendis, D. a. (2007). 
	// Modelling of dynamics and transport of carbon dust particles in tokamaks. 
	// Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion, 49(4), 347–371.	
//	ChargingTimescales();
	
	// DTOKS Charging Test:
	// This test output the potential as calculated by the DTOKS solution to the OML equation.
	// The form of this is such that it depends on the sign of the potential and the magnitude of the total electron emission.
	// This test was used to show the discontinuity in the potential when the total electron emission yield approaches 1
	// Two different conditional formulations of the problem are made and their differences highlighted by this test
//	DTOKSchargingTest();
	
	// OML Charging Test:
	// This test is designed to find the floating potential for small dust grains in a stationary plasma following OML theory.
	// This employs an approximate series expansion to the Lambert W function to find the floating potential
//	OMLTest();

	// MOML Charging Test:
	// This test is designed to find the floating potential for large dust grains in a stationary plasma following MOML theory.
	// This employs an approximate series expansion to the Lambert W function to find the floating potential
//	MOMLTest();

	// SOML Charging Test:
	// This test is designed to find the floating potential for small dust grains in a flowing plasma following SOML theory.
	// This employs an approximate series expansion to the Lambert W function to find the floating potential
//	SOMLTest();

	// SMOML Charging Test:
	// This test is designed to find the floating potential for large dust grains in a flowing plasma following SMOML theory.
	// This employs an approximate series expansion to the Lambert W function to find the floating potential
//	SMOMLTest();

	// Schottky OML Charging Test:
	// This test was made to see what the solution is for electron emission with Schottky correction where the potential of the
	// dust grain is accounted for. The minimisation of the positive solution in C++ is not stable and gives an incorrect 
	// answer. Switching to matlab minimisation function, some weird things happen but, in principle, I showed that the 
	// function could be minimised.
//	SchottkyOMLTest();

	// SchottkyMOML Charging Test: DOESN'T WORK!
	// This test is designed to find the floating potential for large negative dust grains with electron emission 
	// This employs an approximate series expansion to the Lambert W function to find the floating potential
//	SchottkyMOMLTest();

	// ***** FORCE TESTS ***** //

	// IonNeutralDrag Force Test: 
	// This test is designed to compare the relative magnitudes of the ion and neutral drag force.
	// The Ion Drag force is the one that was originally used in DTOKS while the neutral drag is from DUSTT,
	// See Pigarov, A. Y., Krasheninnikov, S. I., Soboleva, T. K. and Rognlien, T. D. (2005)

	// NeutralHeating Test: 
	// This test is designed to asses the heating power of neutral heating over a range of parameters
	// Heating Power is in W/m^2
